A note on comfort: While the typical EEG headsets made of a fabric cap with inserted ring electrodes don’t apply any pressure to the participant’s head, the ThinkPulse™ electrodes are dry comb electrodes. This is very beneficial for super quick setup times. However, they sit directly on the scalp. Due to the 3D printed frame and integrated amplifier the headset is comparably heavy. It turns out that different people reacted very differently to this weight. While some participants didn’t mind wearing it for 45 min, the majority felt quite strong discomfort. We had to remove the headset for a break during the experiment for two participants, and another two had to stop the experiment after 3 and 4 blocks, respectively. Four participants reported that they got a headache from wearing it, lasting between 10 min to 2 hours after the study.
